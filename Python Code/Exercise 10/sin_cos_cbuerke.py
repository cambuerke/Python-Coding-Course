Assignment: 10.4 - Sin Cos
Date: 11/16/2022

Description:
    Plots Sine and Cosine on the same graph so that it can be seen (0 to 2pi)

My contributor(s) helped me:
    [ ] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor.
